\opening{Dear FlixBus Responsible,\\}

I am writing for the position of \textbf{Web Designer},
found in the website Gr√ºnderluft\footnote{\url{http://www.gruenderluft.de/ads/web-designer-m-w}}.
I believe my knowledge and experience is appropriate for this position, and I would like to apply.

I am from Italy, but I plan to relocate to Germany as soon as possible.
I left my position at Net7 in April 2012, and began working as a \emph{Freelance designer}, working mainly on client projects.

I am passionate about design and I feel confortable managing every aspect of the projects I work on. 
All the works listed on my porfolio\footnote{\url{http://antoniopiu.com}} have been selected from my freelance experience only and are relative to the \emph{2012-2013} period.

I have eight years of experience designing websites. I always aim to design simple, yet solid, layouts with a strong focus on accessibility.

I also maintain small personal projects, whose aim is to learn new things, mainly about front-end development.

I learned German for five years during my high school classes, so I have a more than basic knowledge of the language. Still, I can't say I am proficient speaking german at work as time passed since my intensive language camp in Germany.

Anyway I'd like to take courses as soon as I relocate, as it is a priority for me to learn the official language and to speak it regularly.

If you are interested, please get in touch. I am also available
for a call or chat in Skype: my username is \emph{puleddu}.

Thank you very much for taking the time to consider my credentials.

\closing{Sincerely,}
\end{letter}

\opening{Dear Mr. Fabian Wunderlich,\\}

I am writing for the position of \textbf{Senior Product/Web Designer}, found in the website \emph{http://berlinstartupjobs.com/}. I believe my knowledge and experience is appropriate for this position, and I would like to apply.

I am from Italy. I would be willing to move to Germany and start working as soon as required. 

I left my last position at Net7 in April 2012, and began working as a Freelance designer.
The work showcased on my portfolio\footnote{\url{http://antoniopiu.com}} is the track record of the \emph{2012-2013} activity and the projects have been selected from my freelance experience only, so it is possible to easily evaluate the quality and the variety of the design.

Recently I worked as a Web Designer for Turini Group\footnote{\url{http://turinigroup.com/en}}, a well-known italian Law firm, to renew their corporate website network and redesign two of their online services: \emph{Patent Office}\footnote{\url{http://antoniopiu.com/works/ufficiobrevetti}} (focusing the efforts on mobile interface usability) and Brevettinews\footnote{\url{http://antoniopiu.com/works/brevettinews}} (which has been a readability and marketing challenge as I renewed the entire online presenceâ€”including the magazine logo and the newsletter design). 

I have over eight years of experience as a web designer. I use to code the designs I make, using \textsc{html/css/sass}. I also use Git. I am recently learning more about \textsc{ux} and interaction design. I love photography and typography and I think my multidisciplinary experience can be a good contribution for this project.

I had been learning German for five years during high school. Still, I can not say I am not professionally proficient speaking German yet as time passed since my intensive language camp in Germany. Anyway I'd like to take courses as soon as I relocate. I also speak fluent Spanish, basic French.

If you find my profile interesting, please get in touch. I am also available
for a call on Skype: my username is \emph{puleddu}.

Thank you very much for taking the time to consider my credentials.

\closing{Sincerely,}
\end{letter}
